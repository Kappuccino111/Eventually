# Copernicus Hackathon 2025

This project was developed over the course of the [Copernicus Hackathon 2025](https://www.coding-copernicus.de/). The challenged presented was to tackle the problem of how to make the german transport system more nature-friendly. In particular what kind of secondary traffic areas can be utilized for renewable energy generation. A prototypical web app visualizes some of our ideas on a map.
